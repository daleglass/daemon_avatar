# Internet Daemon Avatar

The rights to this avatar were purchased from Maya Remblai by Dale Glass on Second Life a long time ago, who agreed to release it under the CC-BY-SA license. Credit for creating the original avatar should go to Maya Remblai.

The original goal was to have it be part of an avatar collection for alternate grids.
